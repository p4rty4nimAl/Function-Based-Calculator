# Function-Based Calculator

This project attempts to be a calculator made in Java (success!), with very many features, such as:

- Being a calculator!
- Other mathematical features.

It attempts to be better than a regular calculator, which, when compared to this, should look rather dumb as it can only do a select few operations, and cannot chain them together to solve more complex problems.

This calculator can do operations by name*, such as `java -jar FBC.jar -m QUADRATIC -f TURNING_POINT -i "a = 1; b = 2; c = 4"`

*: Not yet implemented.
